- en: Welcome to the world of Spring Security 4.2! We're certainly pleased that you
    have acquired the only published book fully devoted to Spring Security 4.2\. Before
    we get started with the book, we would like to give you an overview of how the
    book is organized and how you can get the most out of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have read this book, you should be familiar with key security concepts
    and understand how to solve the majority of the real-world problems that you will
    need to solve with Spring Security. Through this discovery, you will gain an in-depth
    understanding of Spring Security's architecture, which will allow you to handle
    any unexpected use cases the book does not cover.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first section ([Chapter 1](01.html), *Anatomy of an Unsafe Application*
    and [Chapter 2](02.html), *Getting Started with Spring Security*) provides an
    introduction to Spring Security and allows you to get started with Spring Security
    quickly

    4](04.html), *JDBC-Based Authentication*, [Chapter 5](05.html), Authentication
    with Spring Data, [Chapter 6](07.html), *LDAP Directory Services*, [Chapter 7](08.html),
    *Remember-Me Services*, [Chapter 8](09.html), *Client Certificate Authentication
    with TLS*, and [Chapter 9](10.html), *Opening up to OAuth 2*) provides in-depth
    instructions for integrating with a number of different authentication technologies

    Security Features*, and [Chapter 16](16.html), *Migration to Spring Security 4.2,*
    [Chapter 17](17.html), *Microservice Security with OAuth 2 and JSON Web Tokens*)
    provides information specialized topics and guides that help you perform very
    specific tasks
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Security is a very interwoven concept, and so are many of the topics in the
    book. However, once you have read through the first three chapters, the rest of
    the chapters are fairly independent. This means that you can easily skip chapters
    and still understand what is happening. The goal is to provide a cookbook-style
    guide that when read in its entirety still helps you develope a clear understanding
    of Spring Security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book uses a simple Spring Web MVC-based application to illustrate how to
    solve real-world problems. The application is intended to be very simple and straightforward,
    and deliberately contains very little functionality-the goal of this application
    is to encourage you to focus on Spring Security concepts and not get tied up in
    the complexities of application development. You will have a much easier time
    following the book if you take the time to review the sample application source
    code and try to follow along with the exercises. Some tips on getting started
    are found in the *Getting started with the JBCP calendar sample code* section
    in Appendix, *Additional Reference Material*.
