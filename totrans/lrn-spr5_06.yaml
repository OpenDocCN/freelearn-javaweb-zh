    to us. It was the ocean of data which no one had seen ever before. Before internet,
    the data was only available through hard copies; mainly books and magazines. In
    early days the internet was used just to share the static data, but over the years
    the dimensions, meaning and the use of internet had changed a lot. Now a day,
    we cannot imagine the world without internet. It is simply next to impossible.
    It has become a part of our day today life and a very major source of our business
    industry as well. As a developer for us also it's very important to know about
    the web application, its development, the challenges and how to overcome that.

    then lot many evolutions happened. These evolutions are mainly due to high demand
    of changing world in less of the time. Not only presentation, but also the overall
    web experienced has changed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Jquery and many
    similar technologies. The Servlets handle the web request and use the data from
    the request parameters to extract the data for the dynamic web applications.

    perform the data conversion and bind the data to the objects. Apart from their
    main role in performing the business logic, now they have to handle the extra
    burden of request and response presentation as well.

    They develop the complex, lengthier business logic based on the rules to perform
    the task. But it all will be useless if the data extracted from request parameters
    is incorrect. It's obviously not the fault of the developers but still their business
    logic suffered and there is no point in carrying out business logic with such
    data values. The developers now have to take all the care to first find out whether
    the data extracted from the request is correct or not before performing business
    logic. The developers also have to extensively involve in the presentation of
    the data to the response. To present the data first the developers needs to bind
    the data to the response and then further how to extract it on the presentation
    side.

    in the application is mapped with the URL and users use these URLs to access the
    resources. The Servlet or JSP reads the data from the request object, performs
    the business logic on it and then returns the response as a result. We all are
    well aware of this general flow takes places in any web application. In this flow
    the first and for most concern is that these web applications don't have any Servlet
    or controller who manages the flow of entire application. Yes, the first attainder
    to the application is absent. The entire application and its flow has to be maintained
    by the development side. This is where the major different in between Servlets
    and Spring lies.

    won't be served to the user directly. Instead the response will be sent to the
    Front Controller. Here the response contains the logical name of the view, the
    logic name of the model data and the actual data to bind. Usually instance of
    the ModelAndView is returned to the FrontController.

    on wrong values will always fail. Also there is a chance of getting wrong data
    type values entered by the user leading to exception. Let's take an example of
    email ids. The email id always follows a particular format, if the format is wrong
    the business logic ultimately fails. Whatever may be the case, we have to be sure
    of submitting only valid values either for their data types, range or formation.
    To validate whether the correct data will be submitted or not is the process of
    'form validation'. The form validation plays key role to make sure the correct
    data submission. The form validation can be done on client side as well as server
    side. The Java Script is used to perform client side validations, but it's possible
    to disable it. In such cases server side validation is always preferable.

- en: We had a discussion about web tier in this application. We discussed about the
    working of Spring MVC framework declaring user defined Controller. We had a discussion
    about the views are used to display the values using model object from ModelAndView.
    We also discussed about how the view are discovered by the framework and how they
    are rendered from the logical name set in ModelAndView using ViewResolvers. The
    discussion continued to the form handling where we had in depth discussion about
    form submission to use form backing object and pre population of the form using
    @ModelAttribute annotation. The from containing incorrect values may leads to
    exceptions or failure in business logic. The solution to the problem is form validation.
    we discussed form validation with the help of Spring custom validators and annotation
    based validation provided by hibernate validators. We also had discovered how
    externalization of messages to carry out using messageresource bundle. In the
    next chapter we will continue our discussion about how to carry out testing of
    an application to minimize the risk of its failure when the application goes live.

    Validator提供的基于注解的验证来讨论了表单验证。我们还发现了如何使用messageresource捆绑包进行外部化消息传递的方法。在下一章中，我们将继续讨论如何对应用程序进行测试，以最小化应用程序上线时失败的风险。
